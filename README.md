## 🧠 Inspiration

Post-pandemic life has intensified issues like anxiety, burnout, and loneliness, especially among young people. Traditional mental health support remains stigmatized, expensive, or inaccessible. We wanted to create a safe, fun, and intelligent space where users can regularly reflect, build habits, and receive meaningful emotional support, without fear, judgment, or barriers. Inspired by WHO’s mental health framework, AuraCare was born to make emotional well-being engaging, private, and rewarding.
